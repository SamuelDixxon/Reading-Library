A delightful discovery!

"Birds Aren't Real: The True Story of Mass Avian Murder and the Largest Surveillance Campaign in US History" is a non-fiction book co-authored by Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos. The book claims to expose the truth about "Operation Laysan," a supposed vast surveillance operation using birds as spies, conducted by the United States government.

According to the book's summary, the authors discovered that birds, particularly finches, were involved in a massive espionage program aimed at monitoring the nation's communications, political leaders, and even the general population. The book presents fictional "evidence" and "testimony" from alleged government whistle-blowers to support its claims.

However, it's essential to note that many critics have described this book as a work of satire, aiming to mock and criticize conspiracy theories and the people who believe in them. Some have even accused the authors of perpetuating misinformation and ruining the concept of satire by not making it clear whether the book is meant to be taken as fact or fiction.
