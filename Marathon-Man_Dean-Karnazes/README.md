I think there may be some confusion here!

The book "Marathon Man" is actually a thriller novel written by William Goldman, not Dean Karnazes. Here's a brief summary:

Marathon Man (1974) follows the story of a young dentist named Leon Brody, who is a marathon runner. When his sister is kidnapped, he is forced to run in the Boston Marathon, where he is hunted by a sinister figure from his past. The novel explores themes of obsession, revenge, and the darker aspects of human nature.

Dean Karnazes, on the other hand, is a renowned ultramarathon runner, author, and motivational speaker. He has written several books on running and self-improvement, including "Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner" (2005), which chronicles his experiences running 350 miles non-stop across Death Valley.
