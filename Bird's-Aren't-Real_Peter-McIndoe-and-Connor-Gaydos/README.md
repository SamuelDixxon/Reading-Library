A fascinating and humorous literary endeavor!

**Book Summary:**
"Birds Aren't Real: A Field Guide to Hispternia" by Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos is a satirical field guide that presents itself as a scientific exploration of "Hispternia," a fictional phenomenon where birds are actually, well, not real. The book is an absurd and humorous take on conspiracy theories, absurd internet trends, and the power of confirmation bias. Through a series of "experts" and "research," the authors poke fun at the ways in which people can be led astray by misinformation and pseudoscience.

**Author Information:**
Unfortunately, it appears that the authors, Peter McIndoe and Connor Gaydos, are not real individuals, and their biographies are likely fictional as well. The book is an anonymous publication, intended to be a humorous commentary on the absurdities of online discourse rather than a serious scientific or literary work.
