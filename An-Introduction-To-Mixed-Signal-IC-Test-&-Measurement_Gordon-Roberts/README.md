## Description: (insert description here)
**Book Summary:**

"An Introduction to Mixed-Signal IC Test & Measurement" by Gordon Roberts provides a comprehensive overview of the test and measurement techniques used in the development and validation of mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs). The book covers the theoretical foundations of mixed-signal testing, including analog and digital signal processing, and provides practical guidance on the implementation of test strategies and techniques. The author explains the challenges and limitations of testing mixed-signal ICs and presents solutions for overcoming these challenges.

The book is divided into three parts: Part 1 covers the fundamentals of mixed-signal testing, Part 2 focuses on the testing of analog and mixed-signal circuits, and Part 3 explores the testing of digital and mixed-signal embedded systems. The book includes numerous examples, diagrams, and case studies to illustrate the concepts and techniques discussed.
