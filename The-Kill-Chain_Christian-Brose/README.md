**Book Summary:**

"The Kill Chain: Defending America in the Thirties is a 2021 book written by Christian Brose, a former Staff Director of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The book explores the concept of "kill chain" in the context of national security and defense, arguing that the rise of advanced weapon systems and artificial intelligence has changed the way wars are fought.

Brose, a rising expert on military strategy and technology, describes the kill chain as the sequence of events that occurs when a human operator or AI system targets an enemy asset. He argues that the United States' military strategy needs to adapt to this new reality, focusing on developing capabilities that can fully exploit the kill chain to achieve strategic objectives.

Through a combination of historical analysis and contemporary examples, Brose examines the implications of the kill chain on tactics, strategy, and policy, discussing topics such as autonomous weapons, cyberwarfare, and the role of human judgment in conflict.
