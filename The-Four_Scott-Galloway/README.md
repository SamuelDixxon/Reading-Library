**Book Summary:**

"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google" by Scott Galloway is a non-fiction book that explores the business strategies and competitive advantages of the four most dominant companies in the world. Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, argues that these companies have disrupted traditional industries and created new marketplaces by leveraging their strengths in four key areas: simplicity, integrity, custom, and exclusivity.

Through case studies and analysis, Galloway examines how Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have used these strengths to build their empires, often by creating new markets and disrupting existing ones. He also critiques their impact on society, including issues such as monopoly power, data collection, and addiction.
