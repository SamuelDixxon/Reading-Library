**Book Summary:**
"What the Luck" by Gary Smith is a non-fiction book that explores the concept of luck and its role in shaping our lives. The author, a renowned economist and statistician, presents a series of case studies and statistical analyses to demonstrate how luck, rather than skill or hard work, often determines our outcomes. Smith argues that our perception of luck as mere chance is misleading, and that luck is, in fact, a fundamental driving force in many areas of life, from business and finance to sports and personal relationships. Throughout the book, Smith offers practical insights and strategies for making the most of the luck we encounter, while also being prepared for the inevitable rough patches that come our way.
