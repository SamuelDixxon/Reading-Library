I apologize, but after conducting a thorough search, I was unable to find any information on a book titled "The Twelve Terrors of Christmas" by John Updike. It is possible that the book does not exist or is a rare or out-of-print title.

John Updike (1932-2009) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and poet. He is best known for his series of novels about the fictional town of Eastwick, which include "The Witches of Eastwick" (1987) and "Seek My Face" (2000). He was also a prolific writer of short stories and poetry, and won numerous awards for his work, including two Pulitzer Prizes.

If you are looking for information on Christmas-themed horror or terror stories, I can suggest some popular titles that may interest you:

* "Nightmare Before Christmas" by Tim Burton (1993) - a stop-motion animated film featuring the story of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, who discovers Christmas Town and attempts to take over the holiday.
* "Barefoot in the Park" by Neil Simon (1963) - a play about a young couple's Christmas vacation, which features elements of romance, comedy, and drama.

Please note that these titles are not directly related to the non-existent book "The Twelve Terrors of Christmas" by John Updike.

As I couldn't find information on the book, I couldn't provide links to top Google search results of the book. However, you can try searching for the author's other works or Christmas-themed stories to find relevant information.
