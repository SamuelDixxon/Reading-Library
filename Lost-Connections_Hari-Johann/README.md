**Book Summary:**

"Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions" by Johann Hari is a non-fiction book that explores the author's journey in understanding the causes and solutions of depression. Hari, who struggled with depression himself, embarked on a three-year journey to research and interview experts in the field. He discovered that the conventional wisdom about depression - that it's caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain or a lack of serotonin - is largely false. Instead, he found that depression is often linked to social and economic factors such as isolation, lack of social connection, and social and economic adversities.

The book presents Hari's findings and insights, arguing that the solutions to depression lie not in medication or therapy alone, but in re-humanizing our relationship with each other and with the world. He also explores alternatives to pharmaceuticals, such as talk therapy, exercise, and social connections, and argues that we need to fundamentally change the way we approach mental health.
