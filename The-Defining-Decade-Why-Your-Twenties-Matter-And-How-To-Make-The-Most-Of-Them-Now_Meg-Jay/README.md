**Book Summary:**

"The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter--And How to Make the Most of Them Now" by Meg Jay is a self-help book that argues that the twenties are the most critical decade of a person's life. Jay, a clinical psychologist, contends that the choices made during this period can have a lasting impact on one's career, relationships, and overall well-being.

The book challenges the conventional wisdom that the twenties are a time for exploration and self-discovery, instead advocating for a more intentional and purposeful approach to life. Jay provides advice on how to set a clear direction, make meaningful commitments, and create a sense of stability and security.

Throughout the book, Jay shares real-life examples and case studies to illustrate her points, offering practical guidance on topics such as relationships, careers, finances, and identity formation.
